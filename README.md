# glosa.Net.Rhino
Rhino Support Classes for the [.NET Implementation](https://github.com/elQuixote/glosa.Net) of the [Glosa Geomety Library](https://github.com/elQuixote/glosa) 

### GLOSA GEOMETRY LIBRARY ###
Glosa is a cross platform, high performance geometry library written in Nim by Robert Wells & Luis Quinones at Mode Lab. The main goal behind this library was centered around improving our development turnaround time by removing the need to rewrite many of our algorithms as well as optimizing current algorithms which interface with our daily design and development tools. This process would allow us to create a single and unifying language for connecting disparate platforms.
